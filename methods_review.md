# Methods for analyzing population structure

## distance-based approaches
**1. Weir and Cockerham’s Fst. This is widely used.**

Weir, Bruce S., and C. Clark Cockerham. "Estimating F-statistics for the analysis of population structure." evolution (1984): 1358-1370.

**2. Analysis of molecular variance. This is originally developed on mitochondrial DNA sequences, but Arlequin program has implemented the method for genotypic data. This is widely used.**

Excoffier, Laurent, Peter E. Smouse, and Joseph M. Quattro. "Analysis of molecular variance inferred from metric distances among DNA haplotypes: application to human mitochondrial DNA restriction data." Genetics 131.2 (1992): 479-491.

**3. Weir and Goudet's βst. This has population-specific Fst which may reveal more variation.**

Weir, Bruce S., and Jérôme Goudet. "A unified characterization of population structure and relatedness." Genetics 206.4 (2017): 2085-2103.

**4. Slatkin's Fst using coalescence time, Slatkin's Rst for microsatellite data.**

Slatkin, Montgomery. "A measure of population subdivision based on microsatellite allele frequencies." Genetics 139.1 (1995): 457-462.

**5. Reynolds's Fst**

Reynolds, John, Bruce S. Weir, and C. Clark Cockerham. "Estimation of the coancestry coefficient: basis for a short-term genetic distance." Genetics 105.3 (1983): 767-779.

**6. Nei's Gst**

Nei, Masatoshi. "Analysis of gene diversity in subdivided populations." Proceedings of the national academy of sciences 70.12 (1973): 3321-3323.

**7. Splitze's Qst for quantitative trait. Not relevant to this study but I put it here for completeness.**

Spitze, Ken. "Population structure in Daphnia obtusa: quantitative genetic and allozymic variation." Genetics 135.2 (1993): 367-374.
