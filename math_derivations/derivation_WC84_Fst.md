## Sampling model
There is a single ancestral population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and linkage equilibrium. A number of, r, populations of the same size descend from this ancestral population, and each population is also in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and linkage equilibrium. Samples of alleles collected from these descendent populations differ because of both genetic sampling (genetic drift) and statistical sampling (collect samples from a population).

Original derived in the article "Analyses of gene frequencies"

### Assumptions: diploid organism, one locus, two alleles ($A$, $\bar{A}$)
Let $a_{ij}$ represent an index of jth allele in ith individual. 

Define $x_{ij} = $ 

```math
f(n) =
  \begin{cases}
    n/2       & \quad \text{if } n \text{ is even}\\
    -(n+1)/2  & \quad \text{if } n \text{ is odd}
  \end{cases}
```
