# questions of the work

How the results help conservation of bats? Lillooet population might be separated from Vancouver population, probiotics applied in Vancouver might not spread to Lillooet. 

Choices of sample size and sampling site
- For each site, increase sample sizes to at least 10
- Include Condo as a site, need to wait for MYLU samples for DNA extraction and microsatellite genotyping.

Hayward Lake and Stave Lake Lodge have different structure of bats. Can we see a difference in their genetic patterns?

Landscape genetics
- isolation by distance
- landscape features to include: elevation (MYYU and MYLU use different elevation), human buildings (both species like it, may not see an effect), light (MYYU doesn't like it, but MYLU likes it), Look at Adrian's Pd article on what he used (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8001231/)

The magnitude of Fst is influenced by allele frequencies (https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/193/2/515/6065345?login=false). Do we need some adjustments to compare Fst between MYLU and MYYU?

How microsatellites and SNPs show different results in genetic differentiation?
